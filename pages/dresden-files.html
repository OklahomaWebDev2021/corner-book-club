                  The Harry Dresden Files series of books is my favorite book series. I
                  was intransed the first time that I read Storm Front. I could not wait
                  for each new book to come out. I was deeply saddened by the end of
                  Battlegrounds, but cannot wait to see where Harry's life goes from here.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  Harry has always had a very good moral compass that many of the
                  characters question throughout the books. One exception is his best
                  friend Michael Carpenter.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  Harry has been dogged by the White Council of Wizards because of what he
                  was to become. It is hard not to wonder if that purpose is still going
                  on throughout the books even with the death of the main person
                  attempting to shape Harry against his moral compass.

                          <li>Death is throughout the books</li>
                        </ul>

                      <td class="space text">
                        <p>
                          In this series, I dont read them for the sex or cursing or even
                          the death. I read them because I like the way Jim Butcher develops
                          each of the characters and the relationships between them and how
                          they deal with moral dillema and the whole right and wrong of it
                          all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I like how Jim Butcher brings about every creature of fairy and
                          monster lore into his stories. I like how there is almost if not
                          always a moral right the characters try to adhere to as the
                          stories progress. There is also consequence to most of the decisions that I can find whether the decision is good or bad. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, I like his ability to be able to insert other stories into the series that give more insight into the characters and events of the series. One thing about the stories that I am wondering if Jim Butcher will address, and I am sure he will at some point, is the curse placed on Harry to "die alone". Every woman he has loved has died around him except for Elane.</p>
